# Template-driven Exercise

Add a form with the following Inputs (and validators):<br/>
1 - Mail address (should not be empty and shoud be an email address)<br/>
2 - Dropdown which allows the user to select from three different Subscription ("Basic", "Advanced", "Pro") - Set "Advanced" as Default<br/>
3 - A password field (should not be empty field)<br/>
4 - A submit Button<br/>

Display a warning message if the Form is invalid AND was touched. Display a warning message bellow each input if it's invalid.<br/>

Upon submitting the form, you should simply print the value of the Form to the console. Optionally display it in your template.<br/>
